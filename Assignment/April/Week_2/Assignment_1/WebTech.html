    <h1>Web Technologies</h1>

    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a
        web browser. </p>
    <p>It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
        JavaScript.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
        into multimedia web pages.HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues
        for the appearance of the
        document. </p>
    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects
        such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.HTML provides a means to create structured
        documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,
        paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle
        brackets. Tags directly introduce content into the page.</p>
    <p> Other tags surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
        Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to
        interpret the content of the page. HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript,
        which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.
        The World Wide Web Consortium(W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards,
        has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written
        in a markup language such as HTML.CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
        JavaScript.CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, clors, and
        fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
        specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
        relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and
        enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
        formatting.</p>
    <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in
        different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based
        browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if
        the content is accessed on a mobile device. The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to
        determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority
        scheme is predictable.</p>
    <p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet
        media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free
        CSS validation service for CSS documents.In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS
        including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.</p>

    <h2>JS</h2>
    <p>JavaScript,often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide
        Web, alongside HTML and CSS.Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often
        incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the
        code on users' devices.JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the
        ECMAScript standard.It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. </p>
    <p> It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard
        data structures, and
        the Document Object Model (DOM).The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as
        networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides
        JavaScript APIs for I/O.JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core
        components of some servers and a variety of applications. </p>
    <p>It is multi-paradigm,supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.The most popular
        runtime system for this usage is Node.js.Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective
        standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
